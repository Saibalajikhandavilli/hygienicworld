<h2>Personal Hygiene Practices at Home</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your home should be the most comfortable and convenient for you to keep up your personal hygiene level to a standard, yet, we find ourselves procrastinating over hygiene issues when we are at home. Even though some of these tasks barely take a minute. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Take Regular shower</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not wait up to feel the dried sweat in your body to feel the urge to take shower, make it a routine, you have the choice to either take them before you head to work or after the long day or even before you head to sleep, whichever one suits your routine. Make sure to rinse your body thoroughly, especially the genitals and underarms as they produce more sweat and are more prone to fungal activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Wash your hands frequently</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is our hands that we use to do our most physical acts, from picking up the keys, browsing through our phones to attending our pets. While we acknowledge the importance of washing hands before eating and after visiting the toilet, it is also<strong> important to wash our hands</strong> with soap or sanitizer every now and then. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3.Maintain oral hygiene practices</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caring for your teeth and gum is important, not only to prevent decay related issues but also as they affect neurologically some other sensual organs, they shouldn’t be taken in a light manner. Just brushing them twice a day is not enough, make sure you are using fluoride toothpaste and brushing properly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, you should floss after eating, as this practice will remove plaque, bacterial, and debris that was trapped between teeth which your toothbrush cannot reach. It is a great way to prevent bad breath too. Don’t hesitate to pay a visit to your dentist in slightest discomfort.</p>

<h3>4. Trim your nails and wash your hairs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your nails and hair store dirt and grease. None not to mention the microbes could be in there stuck and spreading. Bad nail hygiene can cause severe food poisoning since you would be preparing or eating your food with your hands. Trim the nails every once they are inappropriately long and wash your hairs at least twice a week to keep them healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Clean your nose and ears</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time you are outside, you are most likely to breathe in some pollutants, and most of the particles are bound to be stuck in your nasal hair. You should rinse your nose and ear with warm water upon return. Especially if you have any specific allergies.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Wear fresh and warm clothes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try to change into some warm and dry clothes, you’ll feel the mental effect immediately as they will boost your mind. Also, regular washing with right detergent matters since like your body, your clothes can be contaminated with germs or microbes, especially if they have been used for several days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Food hygiene is important too</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Personal Hygiene Practices for Kids</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s face it, kids are kids, and you can’t expect them to preside over some “hygiene” issues and it’s a never ending battle. Yet, they are more vulnerable to suffer due to bad hygiene practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.trainingexpress.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Personal-Hygiene-Practices-for-Kids-1024x683.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These above-discussed practices are not only for adults to incorporate in their life. So, it is your duty to make them understand the importance of good personal hygiene. At the same time, try to instill better self-awareness in them. You can practice hygiene habits yourself, like brushing twice a day, bathing regularly, and washing hands after using the toilet and before eating and they follow.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By laying out ground rules early and making sure your kids follow them, you’ll start seeing them take care of their hygiene issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Maintaining Workplace Hygiene</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like your home and body, your workplace can provide access for parasites and germs to get to you. But here you come into contact with many people every day, and there is always a bigger risk of being contaminated through them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Installing and carrying hand sanitizer is highly recommended.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use recycle bins appropriately, if not available, initiate talk to get them installed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use the designated area for lunch and clean afterwards.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Raise awareness among your colleagues of the benefits of good personal hygiene.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Keeping your surroundings neat and clean can be a deal-breaker as it will promote a better working environment both for your mind and body.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Allow and encourage sick days even if it's apparently just a cold. It’s better to have one employee get some rest than spreading the flu in the whole workplace.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t change yourself into a hygiene freak in one day and we’re not asking you to be. It’s about taking these conscious steps to make your personal hygiene better or help your kid develop better habits. You can start by setting reminders, signs or cues to do a certain activity, do it for a week or two and you will get accustomed to it.</p>
