So let’s talk about poor personal hygiene, its impact, and why we need to have daily routines to help keep our hygiene regimen headed in the right direction all the time.</p>

<h2>What’s Poor Personal Hygiene?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h2>The Instances And Effects Of Poor Hygiene</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at a few areas of concern when it comes to poor personal hygiene:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Body Odor</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is probably the most common evidence of poor personal hygiene. Not only does it lead to discomfort and an embarrassing situation for those around you, but there are also other consequences. You could develop allergies, constant itching, and the result of being socially isolated due to your condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When your sweat and the bacteria produced from your apocrine glands interact, it produces body odor. So the more there’s unwashed sweat, the bacteria increases, and the odor gets even worse. But it all starts with poor personal hygiene and bad behaviors like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Infrequent showering.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Wearing dirty, smelly socks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Not airing your shoes</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bad breath (or halitosis) is another of the effects of poor hygiene that impacts your oral health. When you eat, the bacteria that are present on the food particles get stuck on your teeth. Unfortunately, as these bacteria digest, they produce a strong unpleasant odor that is associated with halitosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Poor oral hygiene leads to other problems like tooth decay and bleeding gums. The behaviors that lead to these oral diseases include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Irregular brushing of your teeth</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Not flossing every time you brush your teeth</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Neglecting to clean your tongue when brushing your teeth</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Drinking too many acidic drinks too often</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Excessive smoking</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h3>Influenza</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you know that having the flu can be one of the effects of poor hygiene? You must know how to prevent contamination from any pathogens. You also need to know how to stop the spreading of your germs to other people. Some examples of poor hygiene behaviors in this instance include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<li>Not wearing a face mask when you don’t feel well</li>

<h3>Lice Infestation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Body lice infestation is quite uncomfortable and hazardous to your health. These lice are small insects that live and lay eggs in clothing and bedding. They also feed on the residues found on your skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lice tend to colonize in your armpits and groin, as these are the areas with a lot of humidity. So, it’s important to take regular baths, and wear clean, fresh clothes each day to avoid any lice infestation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avoid doing the following to stave off any such infestation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
